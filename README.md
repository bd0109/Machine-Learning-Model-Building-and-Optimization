# Machine-Learning-Model-Building-and-Optimization using scikit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras
The Machine Learning Model Building and Optimization project focuses on developing a predictive model for loan repayment likelihood using sci-kit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras. This project involves various tasks, including feature engineering, data preprocessing, handling missing data, addressing categorical variables, and model evaluation using f1-score, recall, and precision metrics.

## Project Description
The project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the likelihood of loan repayment. By leveraging the power of sci-kit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras libraries, the project enhances loan management and risk assessment processes by providing informed decision-making capabilities.

Key tasks performed in this project include feature engineering to derive meaningful predictors, data preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency, handling missing data using appropriate techniques, and addressing categorical variables through encoding or feature transformation methods. The project also involves model evaluation using f1-score, recall, and precision metrics to assess the performance of the predictive model.

Through the development of this predictive model, the project enables accurate predictions for loan repayment likelihood, empowering lenders and financial institutions to make informed decisions regarding loan approvals and risk management.
